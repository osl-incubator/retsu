# How to test

You can run `run.sh` in your terminal, and in the web browser you can try the
following endpoints:

- http://127.0.0.1:5000/serial/10/20
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/parallel/10/20
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/serial/result/[TASK_ID]
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/parallel/result/[TASK_ID]

Remember to replace `[TASK_ID]` by the desired process id.
